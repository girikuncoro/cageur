# Contribute to Cageur  
**Guidelines:**  
1. Choose Github issue to contribute (you can also generate your own)  
2. Discuss, question, clarify the issue with team members  
3. Create new branch and commit changes to your branch with convention: `feature/<cageur-component>/<title>` for new feature and `hotfix/<cageur-component>/<title>` for bug fixes. Example: `feature/cageur-api/user-info`  
4. Every implementation must be paired with test cases  
5. Send PR, wait for code review approval from 1 team member and automated testing
